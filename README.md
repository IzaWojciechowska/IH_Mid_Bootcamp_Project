# Mid-Bootcamp Project for Ironhack
# "Sleep and its Relationships with Lifestyle and Stress - Analysis"

## Project Overview
This project delves into the connections between sleep, lifestyle, and stress. Leveraging Python, I conducted an analysis using two datasets: "Sleep Health and Lifestyle" Dataset and "SaYoPillow" Dataset.

## Project Structure
### Datasets:
- `clean_pillow_df.csv`
- `clean_shl_df.csv`
- `SaYoPillow.csv`
- `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`

### Notebooks:
- `SaYoPillow_analysis.ipynb`
- `Sleep_Health_and_Lifestyle_Analysis.ipynb`

### Presentation:
- `presentation.pdf`

### Unused Analysis:
- A folder containing analysis that didn't make it into the final project for transparency.
