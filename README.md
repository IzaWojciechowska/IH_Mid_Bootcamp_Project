# Sleep and its Relationships with Lifestyle and Stress Analysis

## Project Overview
This project delves into the intricate connections between sleep, lifestyle, and stress. Leveraging Python, I conducted a comprehensive analysis using two datasets: Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset and SaYoPillow Dataset.

## Project Structure
### Datasets:
- `clean_pillow_df.csv`
- `clean_shl_df.csv`
- `SaYoPillow.csv`
- `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`

### Notebooks:
- `SaYoPillow_analysis.ipynb`
- `Sleep_Health_and_Lifestyle_Analysis.ipynb`

### Presentation:
- `presentation.pdf`

### Unused Analysis:
- A folder containing analysis that didn't make it into the final project for transparency.

## Tableau Visualizations

## Analysis Highlights
In a nutshell, my findings include:

- Insights into the significance of sleep for learning, immune system, physical growth, and emotional well-being.
- Analysis of Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset showcasing correlations between sleep disorders, stress, and age.
- SaYoPillow Dataset exploration revealing strong relationships between sleep duration, stress levels, heart rate, and sleep instability.

## Project Execution
1. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling:**
   - Ensured data consistency and cleanliness.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**
   - Unveiled hidden patterns and relationships within the datasets.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Split data into X (features) and y (target).
   - Executed Train-Test split.
   - Scaled numerical features for uniformity.
   - Employed encoding for categorical features.

4. **Modeling and Validation:**
   - Trained models with the training dataset.
   - Evaluated model performance through metrics.
   - Iteratively improved models for accuracy.

5. **Reporting and Insights:**
   - Derived conclusive insights from the analysis.
   - Utilized Tableau for visual storytelling.

6. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Formulated and tested hypotheses, adding a layer of statistical validation.

## Conclusion
This project has been a journey into the intricate dynamics of sleep, stress, and lifestyle. Challenges were met, lessons learned, and the journey resulted in a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Grateful for the guidance received throughout this endeavor.
